// create a history store here using useLocation & useHistory!!!

// Okay this is getting to complicated. Need to add one simple property to the project. the state has to remain the same while navigating through the app/webpage. That is the only thing I need to do. I cannot Change the App.js file with routes, I canot make new reducers or action-creators, and I cannot install new dependencies.
